# Medical-Shop-Management
This is a desktop application, for a Medical Shop, built using Java  concepts of Swing and JDBC connection.

Open the "Medical.java" file and enter the username as "admin" and password as "123" from the "owner" database to login. 
This will open the "Main.java" file which contains the operations to be performed on the medicine stock in the "Medicine" database.
Those can be understood by running the application itself.
This application is made entirely in Java.
